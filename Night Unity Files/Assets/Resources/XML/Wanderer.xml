		<Text>The land before me is just as the Necromancer said- dark and dying. Even the dry ground seems to creak with hunger, eager to slake its thirst with my blood. There are others here. They are vague shapes on the horizon and subtle whispers on the wind. Purgatorial souls - fearful and wary. If I am to be alone in my journey then that is the way it must be.</Text>

		<Text>Sensations come and go, like memories without context. Warm light on my back. The green glow of a sunlit canopy, and dappled colour on the ground where the light breaks through. They match nothing of what I have experienced. Here there are no living trees, no leaf-laden boughs, only dead roots, withered stumps, and the stifling heat.</Text>

		<Text>What was once familiar is now foreign to me - the sky a deep shade of crimson, lit by the weak glow of three ailing suns, and the air heavy with dread expectation. At night the heavens glitter with the light of unknown constellations. I am not sure if I will ever share the Necromancer's faith, but if the alternative is a life of solitude and fear then I will go wherever she bids.</Text>

		<Text>Though the ground is arid and the air still, the desert is not completely devoid of life. The gentle rustle of the breeze is broken by the coo of small birds and the churr of insects. The plants I have seen are as brittle and cracked as the dry sand they grow in. The few fruit they bear are wizened, and coloured with such evil hues I would not dare to touch them.</Text>

I cannot remember anything of where I came, nor how I came to be here. It is as if there is a fog in my mind, pushing all else beyond the boundaries of my subconscious.</Text>

Far above I can see a stone roof, arching away into the blackness beyond. I let myself lie back and drift in silence on the murky currents of my thoughts.</Text>

		<Text>It was neither chance nor fate that brought me here. The Necromancer was adamant that I was chosen for this task, that I alone am able to find and awaken the gods, but can I believe her?

The cavernous hall in which I walk broken by monolithic pillar, whose trunks rise unbroken to the ceiling above.</Text>

At first it vexed me, so I approached slowly, only to find it vanish again. Once more I tried, more carefully still, and this time the figure did not vanish. When at last I came upon it, I found a woman. She was clad in ivory robes, and asleep upon the floor. Suddenly I was overcome with unease, for when I looked upon her face, I realised I knew her.</Text>

She sat upon her knees, and I saw the floor around us was no longer dark stone, but white marble, and the blackness around us lifted, revealing an infinite expanse of marbled pillars. There we sat together, waiting for something. But something never came, and I woke confused, with only a greater sense of loss than before.</Text>

I resent her absence when I awake, I think only of her as I walk through twilit lands, and the desire in my heart grows as weariness sets in.

How cruel time is to bring beauty to ruin whilst leaving evil untouched.</Text>

The planks of its hull were rotten, and its metal supports warped and rusted, but I could tell that it was once strong and sleek, able to glide atop the water and weather the heaviest of waves. Even now, shattered, and strewn across the wastes, the beauty of the vessel was clear to me, and I will carry that beauty until the end of my days.</Text>

"One more step" I say out loud, to no avail. For I know it to be a lie, there are many steps ahead, and for what? To what end am I journeying? The struggle is within me, not out there.

		<Text>The old world has been swept away. It is good the Necromancer cannot be with me to see it. If she were to lay her eyes upon the ruins she surely would fall to her knees and weep. Perhaps that is why she whispers to me from the darkness - to shield herself from reality, to allow herself to have hope in a place where none can be found.</Text>

		<Text>I cannot imagine the things The Necromancer has had to endure. Sometimes I think my burden insignificant compared to hers. After all what is the worth of one life against that of an entire civilisation? But we all have our own cross to bear. The more I stay here, the more I see what has been lost. When this is all over I will return to help her, if I can.</Text>

		<Text>The shadow within grows, pressing against my skull. I feel despair well up uncontrollably. My breathing comes shallow and my heart rises into my throat. Panic. My vision tunnels and I collapse to the floor. Then before me I see her, my angel, her cool hand upon my forehead. Memories explode within me, I see her pale face, flowers, white sheets, blood. "Breathe" she says. I close my eyes and breath deep- once, twice, feeling the despair dissipate. Then I open them, only to find her gone.</Text>

		<Text>I do not think I could bear to watch as the places I know fall into disrepair and the people I love age and die. I could not bear to be alone, without anyone to ease my pain. Left with only my unquietable thoughts for company, reliving my lost past over and over. I would watch my past self and wish that I could change the things that can never be changed. And I would wish to go back and spend one last moment with those who are gone.</Text>

		<Text>Another vision. I can see her in the corner of my eye. She sits at the top of a tall set of steps. As I reach the top I realise she is not looking at me, but at the base of a broken statue. Atop the statues' weathered head is a crown- tarnished but still golden. This man, a king, was once well loved by his people. So loved that even today it remained untouched by scavengers. She points at the inscription at its base but I cannot make out the words. The raised stone letters have been worn away by the wind. I will never know his name.</Text>

		<Text>I remember a story I heard once, about an old man. He lived alone in an old cottage. Like him the building had not aged well- its walls were cracked and the roof fallen in. He was bitter and set in his ways, and went out only to buy from the local village what he could not make himself. He had not always been bitter, he had not always been alone. One day there were children playing outside his window. He ignored them as best he could, but an errant ball missed its mark and came through his window with a crash. So he yelled at the children, and drove them back to the village. When he returned he cleared up the pieces of shattered glass, but he could not repair the window. He did not want to return to the village, and so he left it- a gaping void in the side of his house.</Text>

		<Text>Time passed and still the window remained broken. The old man could not repair it himself and did not have the money to pay to have it mended. So the thought of it drifted from his mind, at least until the Autumn came. Strong winds rocked the aged house whilst the lashing rain made its way in through the open window. Day after day it came through until not an inch of the house remained dry. But the old man ignored it- after all, he had endured worse.</Text>

		<Text>Then the cold weather came, bringing snow and frost and ice. The old man huddled for warmth in his broken home, his fire dwindling and his supplies low. Finally he relented, and went to the village to beg to have the window repaired. But it was too late, nobody had the tools to fix the window as broken and warped as it was. They offered him shelter, but his pride took him back home. So there he slept, in the cold and the light of the dying fires, waiting for Spring to come. But there would be no Spring for him, only a deep sleep and a white light, followed by oblivion.</Text>

		<Text>I saw her once again. She sat outside a ruined building reclining on a small drift of sand. So I sat with her, and I asked her how she had escaped her dream prison, but she only gave me a knowing smile and changed the conversation. I do not belong to this world, yet I am growing comfortable here. I am afraid that if I leave I will lose her.</Text>

		<Text>I dream. I ask her where she will go when I return home, but she only smiles and holds her fingers to her lips. I do not pursue the question. I begin to tell her I do not want to lose her, that she must stay with me, but as the words start to leave my mouth I am struck by a flash of painful memories. I awake with a jolt, confused by the bitter-sweet dream. It will not be long before the journey is over.</Text>

		<Text>I turn my ear to the wind and I listen for the gods. I cry out for them, but the only response I find is in the whisper of the sand. I want to hear them, even for a moment, to know they are there. Maybe The Necromancer with her mystic ways is able to hear what I cannot. The world does not feel any different to me.</Text>

		<Text>I see it in my sleep. I hear it in silent places. I even catch glimpses of it when I speak. The darkness, the despair, the weight that lies inside. It is the cold in the pit in my stomach at night, the bleak thoughts when I am alone. The dread thought waxes- the terrible thought that things will not always be. It is the human fear that gives life brilliance. I realise now I have always felt it, but only now that I face the consequence of the fear do I recognise it.</Text>

It is fitting that if I should die, I should die in this bleak landscape, this eternal wasteland. At least it would be a peaceful death- alone, and with no-one to mourn my passing.</Text>

		<Text>I round another corner and there she is. She lies on the floor, her pale face staring up at the sky, surrounded in blood. I rush to pick her up, but as I lay my hands upon her she vanishes like smoke from a fire. As the smoke dissipates, I feel an omen of what is to come.</Text>

		<Text>Though I have seen their tombs and the wretched souls they have left behind I cannot bring myself to believe in the gods. No matter what the Necromancer has promised I do not believe they can help me. I have looked for comfort in faith and I have not found it. I have tried to ignore my pain but it cannot be ignored. Now I realise the only way to be truly rid of it is to confront it.</Text>

		<Text>I admit to myself, I have been selfish. I have sought the tombs not to aid the Necromancer or her world, but to be free of my own suffering. I will be better. We can work together. We can help each other in our struggles. Perhaps then we both can summon the courage to face down our demons.</Text>

		<Text>I am beginning to understand what is behind the shadow within me. Whether by sickness or by age, the white lady will die. And we will not be together. At least I do not believe we will. I cannot convince myself of an afterlife, and so I must face the only alternative. Only now that I recognise it do I see the same fear in the Necromancer. I know what it is she doubts, what she tries to avoid thinking about despite day after day of decay.</Text>

		<Text>The gods will never return. I think deep down she knows this to be truth. The moment I broke open their tombs I could see nothing of the old gods remained. How will she cope when the final gate is opened and the fate of her world is finally sealed. I will be there for her, as she has been for me. But she will have to face her fear alone, as I have done.</Text>

		<Text>So the gods are gone. The vaults of their tombs are empty, their legacy lost in time. The ingenuity of man has failed. The end will come. Though it is not my world the realisation of it's fate sweeps through me like a powerful wind. And with it my burdens are borne away. The weight of my quest has lifted. Now I have certainty over the future, where before there was only uncertainty. The world is doomed, but I still I will complete my quest- for the Necromancer, and for myself.</Text>

		<Text>I pity her, for I know her struggle. I do not know where she will go when the last gate is opened. I do not think she will ever be whole again. Whoever she was all those years ago has been lost. In some ways I envy her faith, without it she surely would not have endured this long. From faith she has drawn strength, but at a cost. The stronger her faith grows, the less willing she will be to accept the truth.</Text>

		<Text>I have heard the suffering in The Necromancer's voice. With every passing moment her faith is tested, the doubt grows in her mind. She has seen the destruction of her home, her world, and her people. She forfeited her life because she believed that one day the world would be cleansed of its corruption. That belief grew stronger with time, growing ever less rational, consuming her. But she had to believe it, because only by the saving the world could her life be saved.</Text>

		<Text>We all are prey to irrationality, we must hold fast to the belief that our dark days precede the light. Without it we would be paralysed in hopelessness. Only through this belief are we able to change the course of our lives. We can push against the currents of reality rather than allow ourselves to be swept away. To give in is not in our nature, to lay down our arms at the feet of our aggressors rather than fight for what we hold dear. Our belief allows us to overcome horror and sorrow, and go on striving for better days, even when we ourselves may not see them.</Text>

		<Text>Finally she comes to me. She looks different though, somehow strained. Her body is thinner and the lines of her face deeper. Not ill-looking like before. Merely... tired. An extreme tiredness that cannot be recovered by sleep alone. She speaks it with a whisper and I cannot make out the words. I put my head to hers, and she will not meet my gaze.</Text>

I stand in front of her, forcing her to come to a stop. I wrap my arms around her, and wait. At first she remains motionless. I can feel her gaze locked ahead and sense the distance in her arms. Then, slowly, she bows her head into my shoulder and returns my embrace.</Text>

She sits on the ground, so I join her. Finally, she talks.</Text>

She said I would understand when I entered the last tomb. I asked her to speak clearly, to tell me what she meant. Confusion washed over her face, and her eyes snapped back to the horizon. She did not follow me any further, so I continued on alone.</Text>
