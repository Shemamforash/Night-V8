		<Text>Once I had a family- a husband, and a daughter. We lived in a haven, a place where the essence had not yet reached. It was a hidden place, protected from the evils of the world. We had crops and animals, so none would go hungry, and fields of fertile earth in which to grow them. The water from the streams was clean and cool, and the miles of surrounding forest hid us from prying eyes. I doubt it still remains. Every time I go looking I find myself wandering in circles amongst endless dunes and wasted plains.</Text>

		<Text>There were others in the haven- families, survivors, refugees, and wanderers like yourself. Together we worked the land, but never were we one people. We were too different, some spoke a different language, some were from a different culture. We were forced together by hardship, but never did we truly bond. Some of us were born in the sanctuary, innocent of the wider world, others looked at the world through stricken eyes, never quite seeming present.</Text>

		<Text>With every wanderer that passed through, every vagrant that found a home among us, the tension among us grew. We worried the haven would be discovered. So gradually we became more divided. There were those of us who welcomed any who needed shelter, and there were those who rejected and distrusted outsiders. As time passed our community became larger and larger, and with each new member came stories from the outer world- stories of barbarism, murder,and inhumanity. The bonds between us grew taut, and eventually a day came when they broke.</Text>

		<Text>A bleached, wide-eyed wastelander came to our village. He was not like others that had come, there was something unhinged in him. Nevertheless, we found him a bed, fed and watered him, and left him to rest. He would not speak, but his leering eyes danced across every man, woman, and child he passed. Ill at ease we turned in for the night. In the early hours of the morning we were woken by a peal of bells. A young woman had been found, her beaten body lay across the threshold of the wastelander�s hut. There was no hesitation, no discussion on what was to be done, we simply drew him from his tent, and cut his throat.</Text>

		<Text>When the graves were filled we argued about what should be done. Words turned to accusations, and accusations into insults. By midday the first stone had been thrown, and sure enough others followed. The village turned to chaos, so I gathered my husband and daughter together and we ran as far into the forest as we could. There were others- families, couples, elders, and children, all running from the village. We could hear the pursuit behind us. The people we had lived with every day now hunted us like we were animals. I did not dare to look back, I only ran. By the time the shouts and screams had died away I was lost. The trees had thinned, and the rich soil turned to the sand and dirt of the great wasteland. I turned to find my family, but I could not see them. I tried to return to the village, but I could not find my way back. To this day I have not seen them. I tell myself they are lost now, but I will keep searching, I will hold out hope until the day I die.</Text>

		<PartNumber>1</PartNumber>
		<Text>My rage is eternal, enduring through the red dust and dark fire of our broken world. I have no enemies, for those that look upon my countenance see only death, but still I cut down those who stand before me- those whose eyes betray the rotting soul within. There is a dark shadow within us all, a hidden thing kept at bay by our civil self. It is in our most passionate moments that it is set free, free to do what our primal instinct knows should be done. They say that the world fell because our minds were changed, that we were turned evil by devils or monsters. They are wrong. The devil is a part of us, it is a reflection of our surface selves, the inversion of our conscious mind. It is the essence in the air that drew it out, empowering it, and allowing it to maraud openly. But I have controlled it, I let it escape, feed, exert it�s will through my hand. It is this freedom that prevents it from taking a hold of me. I acknowledge it, and so we coexist.</Text>

		<PartNumber>2</PartNumber>
		<Text>There is no greater power in the world than the unchained beast. However an unchained animal will wreak havoc if untrained. We must use exert our will to remain in control, to speak to the beast and let it know that we are the alpha, we allow the beast to exist, and without us, it would die. When the covenant is made between you and the beast it is like a weight lifted from your mind. Our darkest thoughts are free to expose, explore, and exploit. I revel in my freedom, I have shirked the shackles of civilisation to sate my primal thirst. Do not care for those who would do you harm, for they are nothing but fodder for the beast. Instead liberate them from their earthly duties, spill their blood on the sand, for in the absence of darkness, there is light.</Text>

		<Text>What there is beyond death I do not know, perhaps the pearlescent gates are real, or perhaps we will go to the halls of our ancestors, to revel forever amongst our lineage. Or perhaps there is only darkness, nothing stretching from here to infinity. One day we all shall discover what lies beyond, but whilst we exist on this side of the veil we must live. That is why the beast is important, it gives us life, it is our source of true emotion, raw feelings. If anyone reads this, go forth, allow the wolf within to burst forth, say those words that are unsaid, seek vengeance when justice is undone, conquer the oppressors and lift up the meek. And if you should fall in your pursuit for balance, you will know that it was for a glorious purpose that your fire was snuffed. The worst that can befall is that we instead allow our flame to dim and die in the darkening of the night, our mind full of regrets and things left undone.</Text>

		<Title>The Fall</Title>

		<PartNumber>1</PartNumber>
		<Text>Atop the highest pinnacle of an ancient rig a man sat upon his throne. He made sure he was above all others, able to see for miles and miles around. Many worked for him, some dug at the ground beneath their feet, others were there for his pleasure. Every month, in an attempt to show his humanity, he would gather his people, and select one to bestow a great gift upon. He would take them out of the settlement in his great vehicle, far beyond the horizon, to a place no-one saw or knew about. The people of the settlement lived for this great gift, they would praise his name in the hopes that one day they too would be able to go to the paradise.</Text>

		<Text>One day a mother and her child came before the warlord. With croaking voices they begged him to leave. And so he laid his great hand upon them, and spoke the words they most desired to hear. The others watched on longingly, some wept, whilst others cursed in frustration. The mother and her child descended with him. Deep through the the great machine they went, down to the salty floor below. He beckoned for them to enter the vehicle, and begin their journey to salvation. It was far, to go beyond the bounds that confined them. The self-proclaimed king spoke not a word, and gave them not a glance. He allowed them supplies to sate their moaning bellies and quench their dry throats.</Text>

		<Text>Days passed, the warlord driving without sleep, before they finally stopped. Before them was a great plain. Their breath was stolen from them as they gazed upon miles and miles of grassland. So flat it was that it would drive the mind to madness if one were to gaze at it long enough. The mother started to weep, for she knew that despite the rivers that ran through the land, despite the green fields that beckoned to her, she knew it was as hostile to life as any desert. She knew that this would be the end. She turned to the driver, imploring him to return them home. But he refused, in his mind this was a paradise, how could anyone refuse this great green place.</Text>

		<Text>You cannot go back he said. For if they were to return the magic would be shattered for his people. They would be crushed by the reality of the world. Suddenly the woman spun round, digging her fingers deep into his forearms, running them down his flesh in long red streaks. He screamed out in pain and pushed her to the ground. Blood spilling onto the blinding white floor, immediately absorbed by the grateful earth. He ran back to his car, started the engine, and drove away as he tried to tend to his wounds. Glancing up, he saw her in the mirror, still on the floor, a mask of anger worn upon her face. As they grew smaller he knew his reign had ended. He could not give hope to his people, not now that the veil had been lifted from his eyes. And so exiled himself into the desert. His compassion towards his people blinded him to the reality of his actions. To this day he carries those scars, a reminder that we are all equal in the dust.</Text>

		<Text>I once met a band of wandering holy men. �Hail�, I said, for the road was lonely, and any company was welcome. �Bless you, daughter�, they said, though I was not their son, �Are you making the pilgrimage too?� they asked. �No, brothers, I am not. For this is a godless world, and faith has no place in it� I replied. At this they made an unusual smile. �My daughter, do you not believe in the gods?� asked one. �It is well known that the gods abandoned our world, so why would I worship those that would leave us to this fate?� I replied. �But my child it was not they who caused the world to come to ruin. Their plan is perfect, it is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves worthy. That is our pursuit� another said. �Then that is a worthy goal, and I commend you for it, but by testing our worthiness the gods have demonstrated that they do not have faith in us. So why should I have faith in those who do not have faith in me?�.</Text>

		<Text>Some time later we made camp. The sun had begun to set, and the holy men were not comfortable walking in the dark. One of the group sat on the ground next to me and we watched the sun go down. �It is a beautiful gift, don�t you think?� she said. Confused, I asked �What do you mean, a gift?�. �The sun- it is a gift from them, as are our eyes so that we might see it.� she said. �You believe they gave us the sun?� I asked. �Why of course, they gave us everything they created� she said. At this I was silent for some time. �I shall tell you where my doubts lie, sister. You say the world is a gift, for which the gods ask nothing in return, but you do not see it how I do. If it is a trivial task for them to create all that exists, so then it is nothing for them to give it away, for it is worth nothing. On the other hand if it was no trivial task, and required everything from them, then what they receive is servitude- belief and worship. This then shows that they are selfish, they gave us gifts expecting our praise in return. I see no reason to worship a being who would give us something worthless to them, or one who would give us something, only to make a demand we cannot refuse as payment.

		<Text>Deep in the salt sea there was a church. Whether it still stands I am not sure. It sits above the great saline cracks, under the unbearable heat of the sun. They say it once sat on an island in the midst of a shallow sea, brilliant blue, and teeming with life. It was not this way when I saw it. My father took me to this church on my tenth birthday. The salty air inside was as stifling as it was hot. I remember feeling the beads of sweat trickle down my back as I sat and listened to the ancient boards of the wooden walls creak in the breeze. He stood by the altar at the head of the church, and he commanded me 'Son, tell me what you see here�.</Text>

		<Text>At first I did not understand, there was nothing of note to be seen, other than the ancient building itself. So I told him just that. �And that is exactly why I brought you here.� he said. �This church is the last worship place of the gods, and yet there is no one here, there are no worshippers, no candles, not even a seat for a pilgrim to sit� he went on. �This is because the gods are ignorant, boy. They have abandoned us. There will be no response to our prayers, we drive our own path in this world.�.</Text>

		<Text>Years later, with the great salt sea and the dessicated church far behind me, I thought back on my father�s message. It had seemed so far to go to make that point. And yet it has always stuck with me, there are many who still pray for better times, for their children, and their crops, and their sick. But I never have, not since that day. It was not long after that my father took ill. It was the waste that took him, bound him to his bed, dishonoured his pride. Not once did he pray on his deathbed. He did not ask for medicine, for he knew there was none, he had consigned himself to his fate. Though he was not without strength, he continued to teach me the way of the hunt, even until his final breath.</Text>

		<Text>Now I scour the barren wastes of our world, ever tracking my prey, hunting the unjust. I do so without the gods behind me. The only measure of justice to be found lies in my hands, in the keenness of my eye, and the surety of my arm. Only the fool waits for justice from the divine. And whilst the fool waits, the thief takes what he wishes. Some may preach, they may say that our acts come about, that the farmer reaps what he sows, but I believe in vengeance. I believe in the immediacy of physical judgements that show the thieves and the scoundrels that there are those who exact their own divine will. As a hunter, that is my path, the path of retribution and the doom of the malign.</Text>
