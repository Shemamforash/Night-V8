		<Text>Dreams are strange things, at once real and unreal, utterly convincing are they in their recreation of reality that waking up becomes a shock to our senses. The sudden shift in reality from our dreams to the waking world can be a relief when our dreams are dark, but can be unwelcome when our reality is darker. Though my dreams are indeed dark, it is reality that is my true nightmare. Each morning I am paralysed, able only to stare at the sky, for my body does not respond to my impulses, and my mind has sunk so deep into itself that I feel as if I have no sense of self. I am merely a consciousness, free floating above a dying body.</Text>

		<Text>Last night I slept well, for the first time in a long time. The terrors that plague my dreams were strangely absent, and my dreams themselves were� strangely empty- like a thick fog had filled my mind, pushing all dark thoughts to the side. And so my unconscious self could lie back, drifting slowly in the murky currents, in silence, devoid of thought. I believe it is the strange, thick air of this world that is the root of this change.</Text>

		<Text>Before coming here I oft would awake violently, panting and covered in layer of sweat, white knuckled fists digging bloody nails into my palms. But not any more. The fog from before has parted, and tonight I dreamed of a woman- pale skinned and dressed in layers of ivory cloth. In my dream she lay on the floor before me, sleeping. I did not want to wake her, so I sat. As I sat I watched the rise and fall of her chest, the almost imperceptible throb of her veins, the occasional flutter of her eyes beneath closed lids.</Text>

		<Text>Despite her slumber, I found her presence welcome, even calming, though on her face I saw changes- fleeting grimaces, as if in pain. I felt my emotions ebb and flow like the tide, and I allowed myself to be borne away on their currents. With those feelings came glimpses of the past, my past. These are my memories, I am sure of it. But as the cold hand of reality pulled me back into the waking world, my feelings faded, and I soon found myself returned to this bleak and desolate world.</Text>

		<Text>Again I slept soundly, and again I saw the woman in my dreams. This time, however, she was not sleeping, but sitting fair upon her knees, her long fair hair rolling down her back onto the floor around her. So again I sat with her, and we did nothing but look into one another�s eyes. That feeling of forgotten memory came back then, for she had familiar eyes- green with specks of grey, beautiful yet tired. We spoke softly to each other- whispering, so as not to upset the fragility of the dream. I cannot recall her words, but she spoke of sickness, and now that I try to remember what exactly she spoke of, I am filled with a heavy dread. In my dream-state I did wonder how she knew of my quest, of the Necromancer, and of this place. But now that I am awake it is obvious that she is a part of me- she knows what I know. Yet I cannot shake this feeling that she is also a part of this world.</Text>

		<Text>This time we spoke more freely, for I am determined to understand her. If she is a part of my psyche, then I must now why, and if she is not a part of me, then I must know who she is. I asked her how she knew where we were, how she knew who I was. I tried to ask her gently at first, but when she would not answer my curiosity turned to frustration, and as it so easily does, my frustration turned to anger. She turned her face to hide, but I could see the tears upon her cheek. I knew then, that it did not matter who she was. She has not appeared to me to be my guide, to lead me to my fabled destiny, she is here to be a companion, to give me respite when I sleep, to give me something to live for when my will is spent. She is here to be with me, in my dreams, as I trek across this wasted world. So I took her in my arms, and we were silent for a time, in a familiar embrace, until I awoke. When I opened my eyes I did not see an ivory angel, only the dead sky above.</Text>

		<Text>Though at first it was occasional, I see her every night now. Sometimes she is silent, sometimes she sleeps, and sometimes she wants nothing other than to talk. It does not matter if she is real or not anymore. She listens to me, and I her. We talk of things we love, things we lost, of our present selves and our future desires. Sometimes I remember glimpses of my past- a green world, with soft earth and a blue sky. I remember other people, not the parched and brittle people of this world, but glowing, smiling people- friends perhaps, and family. She says she has memories too, painful ones, that she wished she could forget, but could not bear to lose. Suddenly she turned to me, her eyes wide, and she said to me that there are good memories to remember, but there are painful ones too. She said I must be ready to face what is coming, but what is coming?</Text>

		<Text>My dreams grow in intensity as my reality wanes. Whilst my eyes go dull, my dreams become vivid, and with them she becomes more alive.</Text>

		<Text>The dreams are more intense now, my angel is more animate then ever, and it is draining me to the core. Some nights she is happy, we sit and talk of half-remembered times, and entertain each other with our company. But on some nights I cannot bear to be with her. She shouts and yells, kicking and screaming in her dream-prison, then suddenly breaks down in my arms and cries herself to sleep. Though I do not know her face, there is a familiarity when she touches my skin. My mornings are filled with dread. I cannot stand to see the sun, because even on her worst nights, I would rather be dreaming with her, than awake in this midnight world.</Text>

		<Text>I did not dream well. Once again she was there, waiting for me, but she was not the same. Her face was gaunt, her limbs thin, and her eyes wide in deep sockets. She broke into tears when she saw me, but no matter how much I comforted her she would not stop. I held her close for the entire night, but she could not reciprocate- she was so weak she could barely lift her arms, and her breathing was shallow and fast. She tried to speak several times, but she could barely muster a whisper. I hushed her quiet, told her we were doing well, that she was safe. I did not remember anything new that night, instead I have been haunted by her cries even in the face of day.</Text>

		<Text>She tried to speak to me last night, but I could not hear her, for she was too far away. I tried to run to her, but I could not get close enough to speak to her. Instead I could see her eyes wide with terror, and her mouth open to scream. Now I could hear her, but it was a muffled scream as if from under water. She screamed and screamed, the muscles on her atrophied arms tensed and relaxed in spasm. Then I too was screaming on my knees with my head in my heads. It did not end, it just went on, the endless wailing, and the tears. All I wanted to do was to hold her again, to stop her screams. But I could not.</Text>

		<Text>I am at a loss. The woman of my dreams is silent now, she does not try to speak, she does not move. If it were not for the shallow breathing of her chest, I would think she had passed on. The fervour of my past visions has gone, replaced with hopeless waiting. I stand in an endless room, unable to do anything but watch her rest. Time passes imperceptibly slowly, and I cannot take my eyes from her. Truly this is hell, to watch, and wait, and not know what to do, until the hours of your life have wasted away. I wake slowly now, gazing at the sky every morning. My limbs betray me, and my mind will not focus. I fear I am losing myself to this world.</Text>

		<Text>Finally things have changed for the better. The pallor of her complexion replaced with a warm glow. Her eyes were bright, and her smile broad. We spoke freely again, of trivial things, our likes, our dislikes. I told her of the things I had remembered since we last spoke- happy memories, places I had been. She told me she remembered them too. Although I wanted to ask her what would happen to her after I left this wasteland, I did not want to upset her mood. To see her so well filled my heart. She said she was sorry about what happened before, that she had been ill, and that she would not be ill for much longer. I told her not to apologise, that all I wanted was to be with her and see her well. It was then that she nodded her head and gave me a longing look. I saw something in that moment, a sudden painful memory that came and went in a flash. I woke suddenly, confused by the bitter-sweet dream. It is not long until I finish my journey.</Text>

		<Text>We shared another quiet night. She looked well again, though there was a sadness in her voice that couldn�t be displaced. She asked me about the world, but I did not wish to tell her about it. I sensed that her fate is somehow related to the fate of the gods. Instead I told her that the essence was retreating, that it would not be long before I opened the final gate. I expected her to be elated, to beam and throw her arms around me. Instead she smiled weakly, and became quiet. I did not speak further. I did not know what to say, so I let the silence say it for me. We held hands, and when the time came to wake, I kissed her softly. As I left the dream world she held her hand out to me, and said she loved me.</Text>

		<Text>Now I am alone. When I fell asleep she was gone. I called out for her, but there was no answer. I ran through the endless corridors of my mind to find her, but there was nothing but emptiness. I knew she would not return. I had not opened the gates in time, and now she was gone forever. I sat in my dream world, overwhelmed with emotion. Despair and relief washed over me in equal measures. She would not be in pain any longer, but I do not think I can go on without her. The world is so bleak, so harsh, that without hope I cannot hope to overcome it. Despite our short time together, I will not be able to forget her, I know she will be with me until my last breath.</Text>

		<Text>The fog has cleared, and the memories return. The woman, the angel of my dreams, she was real once, a long time ago. I know this, because I was there with her at the end. She believed we would meet again, beyond the veil, she believed it because she had to believe it. Because it was the only thing that would ease the truth of her passing, we knew that nothing could be done for either of us. I am not sure if I believed that we would meet again, but the lie was so sweet. We used the lie to spend our last times in peace and not fear. To pretend to each other as if we were going on a long journey was far easier than to speak a final farewell.</Text>
