We who face death find ourselves in these wild lands. 

She is gone. Her blood spent on the dry soils of the earth. I am lost, wandering in places only evil will tread. Her voice guides me in the darkness, it brings me to this place. We can be together again, she says, and I can only believe her.

All that was us is behind us, running from the thing that we are told we cannot escape. But we know different. We know there are things in the great wilderness ahead, ancient things amongst the ruins of dead gods and wasted civilisations. There we roam and dwell, together in solitude we search for that protection which was promised us. The sands are not silent here, there is a storm in the desert. It comes with the regularity of the tide, bearing with it the power to sweep clean we devils who look for the divine things that are not ours. The ceaseless approach of the dust and wind that bears it counts down our life, one heartbeat at a time. Everything here seeks to break the minds of men. This is why our quest is so dire, we come here to look for eternal life, but by doing so we risk early death. I do not believe it will find me here. There is a spectre, a dark shade who comes to me. 'Five Gates' he says, 'Five Gates and Five Keys', over and over again he whispers in the dark of night, where even the distant stars will not give me company, and I am left to dwell in my own thoughts. So, like many before me, I have come here to find endless life. 

The First Gate is hidden in a forest of petrified branches and glassy leaves. There was a time when I could fill myself on the life of the forest. We would walk together in silence, savouring the cool air on our skin, and drifint away together to earhtly music of the leaves. Now the forest is dead, its roots withered, the breeze that once whispered gently through the treetops has become a wail, and the warm glow of sunlight on the grass underfoot is now a pall of ash. The sunlight burns my skin, so I keep to the shade.
