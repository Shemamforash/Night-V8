        <Title>Essentia: Eo</Title>
        <Group>1</Group>
        <Part>1</Part>
        <Text>The Corruption of Eo, which now resides somewhere in the veil, takes the form of an enormous skeletal serpent. The form of a serpent is interesting as Eo, goddess of hope, was often
            represented as an owl swooping down upon the supposed manifestations of despair, generally depicted as a snake. The implications of this form indicate that either Essence has some will of
            its own, or more likely, that it�s shape is influenced by the strongest emotions within a being. In almost every case these emotions are negative- suppressed anger, primordial fear, greed,
            and others. Given this knowledge, we have at least some advantage over essence, furthering my hopes that we might one day channel it, and slowly return our world to how it was.

        <Text>Hythinea, the warrior queen, and her kingdom Hythia, can all be found deep in the great mountain ranges of the north. In the days of old these lands were renowned for their fertility,
            and in the infancy of our civilisations were protected by Hythinea herself. Ferocious but fair, her traits were soon idolised by the people of her kingdom, who built their society around
            her values. Soon Hythia became the dominant kingdom of the five, and became infamous for their strength in the great war that precipitated the end of our world. Little is know about her
            Corruption, it has never been seen outside of the veil, or the world between the gates. However, given our knowledge of the other Corruptions, we can assume that personifies the opposite
            of her personality, most likely injustice, bloodlust, ignorance, and hostility.

        <Part>3</Part>
        <Text>The god Rhallos imbued solidity, determination, and resolve. It is not unexpected then, that the form of his corruption is that of a disparate hive of flying things. Some have seen it in
            our world, like a living cloud that passes over the land devouring any living thing with its hundreds of tiny jaws. Although not the most terrifying of the Corruptions, it instills
            feelings of absolute hopelessness in those who see it. Thankfully I have only heard this from third parties, or I fear I would not be able to write this down for even recollecting the
            events caused most of my sources to break down in tears, and in one case, turn completely rigid and unresponsive to anything around them.

        <Group>1</Group>
        <Part>4</Part>
        <Text>Vidium, or Moonmetal as it is sometimes known, is a peculiar alloy found only in meteorites. It is unknown if it could be found naturally before the Absence, but can now be found in
            relative abundance (for a rare metal) due to increased cosmic activity. Although essence appears to affect all things in at least some degree, Vidium has a strong focussing effect that
            apparently draws essence towards itself. For this reason alone Vidium is extremely difficult to gather, and even more so to manipulate. The properties of this pitch black metal are
            extremely desirable however, and is now highly coveted in the manufacturing of war machines and weaponry.

        <Group>2</Group>
        <Part>1</Part>
        <Text>The effects of Essence are always sudden, but not always apparent. The subtleties of its nature mean that rather than a sudden outburst against all nearby, or an immediate and incurable
            fear that causes a man to gouge out his own eyes rather than face the world, the influence of Essence can go unnoticed for extremely long periods of time. Sometimes the effect is so
            subtle, given a host of good character and strong will, that it never manifests outwardly (though it is extremely where). In other cases it grows over time, embeds itself in the
            subconscious, ultimately leading to betrayal, desertion, sedition, and murder. I believe this clearly demonstrates it is the hosts will that gives form to the Essence, and that the Essence
            itself has no ability to decide whether its manifestation is benign or malign.

        <Group>3</Group>
        <Part>1</Part>
        <Text>I will document, for the purposes of posterity, the details of our order. After it became clear that the world was dying through no fault of our own, the learned people of the five
            kingdoms came together to form the Order of Mystics. Initially the group was loosely defined, it�s members came and went as the Essence exerted its influence across the world. I, and a few
            others, formed a small band dedicated to understanding the Essence, and how it came to be. It did not take us long to draw the conclusion that it was the absence of the gods that gave rise
            to the calamity that was before us, and that it was their presence that maintained some sort of balance in the Essence that exists within our world. At that time we were aware of the
            existence of Essence, but its nature was foreign to us, and we were not unanimously convinced of its existence at first.

        <Text>Over the years our order watched the kingdoms of our world fight against each other, and one by one each fell. Whether in the tracks and weaponry of the battlefield, or by the slow
            decline of authority they all fell. It was becoming apparent that a great collapse was coming soon. It could be felt all around like the acrid taste on the tongue before lightning strikes.
            We resolved that our efforts to manipulate the Essence were paramount, that we must find a way to use it, or our entire world would unravel around us. We could see that the borders between
            the kingdoms were fading, the scars of war filled in slowly by the sands of encroaching deserts. Eventually, we knew, it would be impossible to cross between the kingdoms. It was then that
            the idea of the gates was born, we would utilise our technology and research on Essence to create a portal in each kingdom. Each portal would allow free travel to another kingdom, forming
            a spine, if you will, across the world. What we did not realise at the time, however, was that without a body capable of channelling essence, these gates would be useless to us.

        <Text>The Necromancer was an idea that arose over a period of months, after we realised that the now complete gates were all but useless to us. Many of us gave up, threw our hands in the air
            in anguish, and simply disappeared into the wastes. Those that remained, myself included, resolved to find a solution. Though I cannot speak for the motives of the other Mystics, I
            resolved to do all I could because the alternatives were simply too bleak to consider. Without the ability to pass between the gates we would be without the ability to communicate with the
            now isolated communities scattered amongst the five kingdoms, and without the ability to restore the world. It is worth noting that our studies at this point had turned to what could at
            best be considered arcane and at worst sorcery. Manipulating essence is no simple matter. Through various testing methods we found that the most effective, yet unpleasant, way of
            channelling essence was through pain. I am sure that to whoever reads this account, assuming anyone is left to read it, will think us as sun-scorched mad men, making blood pacts and
            casting magic spells into the darkness. How I wish this were not so.

        <Text>It was in the Autumn of the year 3346 that we made our ultimate choice. We did not force anyone to stay, those who were in the dark were informed of our intentions, and given the
            opportunity to leave. Few did, some stayed out of loyalty, others because leaving was simply no better than what was ahead. One of our order was chosen, a young woman- an acolyte from the
            mountain kingdom. There has been no protest over what we are about to do, because there are no other options. We grew weak with every day that passed, and every day the essence spread
            further, rooted deeper, hung heavier in the air around us. I am sorry, reader, that we could not do more. This will be the last entry in my histories, if they can be called that. I do hope
            that there will be enough future to fill the remaining pages of this book.[br][br]With hope, Oranos.

        <Text>The King has given his orders, the captains have gone to relay them into the city. We are left here together, the rulers of this kingdom. The king sits upon his throne at the head of the
            room, alone and brooding. We are left to discuss our options, it is clear we are at war, whether it is in the best interests of our land or not, we are at war. My peers seem excited by the
            prospect, as if the encroaching bloodshed has somehow been expected and deserved. I have no doubts that the courts of the four other great kingdoms are issuing their own orders, and that
            their Kings and Queens have withdrawn into the same solitude as our own. I will not lie my own thoughts have been darkened of late. I fear there has been a change in us, all of us, across
            this entire world.

            aplenty, peacekeeping missions, suppression of dissidents, but never war. I am proud to serve my country, and my Queen. I will remember looking out from our battlements onto a sea of
            gleaming metal, and a sky streaked by the trails of our warships, what a glorious sight. I hear people say our Kingdom cannot be defeated, that our lands are too great and our military too
            vast. If they are right then the coming war may also be the last war, for we will reign eternally after our victory![br][br]-Optio

        <Text>Today we broke into the city of Hispellum, infantry following the path of our siege engines straight into their main square. Only to find the resistance we expected was absent. The city
            was silent, the defenders on the walls were silent now- dead or dying. But here there was nothing, no signs of flight, banners taken from their polls. It is as if it had been abandoned for
            years. We searched house after house, looked in the warehouses, the armouries, the keeps, all the way up to the court and even the monarch�s tombs. It was then, as we stood in the court of
            Hispellum, before the throne of the King, that a strange feeling came over me. It has been at least a decade since I left our fair city. A decade that me and my men have lived in the great
            battlefields that now scar the space between our lands. I worry that if I were to return home, that I would find our halls empty, I would find my family fled and my house deserted. We have
            fulfilled our duty, we have taken the city. But now we are without orders and there are now none to issue them. It is bitter sweet, this victory, for on the very day of our victory, we are
            turning about, and returning home.[br][br]-Optio

        <Text>We did not make it home. As we crested the horizon, and the great towers of Pyrrha came into view, a cry of despair rose up. For we could see, even at this great distance, that our city
            was ruined and deserted. There was no life on the charred plain before us. Some of my brothers and sisters fell to their knees and would not be moved. Some ran for the city, others away. I
            did not stop anyone. There was no reason. It was clear my instinct was right- somehow over all these years, through all the battles and the roaring of thunder, we have destroyed ourselves.
            Our kingdoms have fallen, where our people are I do not know. What will become of us I do not know. What I do know, that I predicted all those years ago, and that has now been confirmed by
            the horrifying sight ahead, is that this war was indeed the last war of our world.[br][br]-Optio

            it�s impossible to tell if she is already beyond the point of no return. She is safe now, deep in the mountain. The other sisters are caring for her now. If she recovers I am not sure how
            we will be able to look after her, we barely grow enough for us alone, never mind enough for a growing child. But then the alternative is unthinkable, to take her back out into the
            wasteland to eek out her life amongst marauders and devils? I will pray for answers tonight, the goddess always provides for her followers.

            across the world like a disease. Some of our neighbours scoffed and ignored him, busy with their own troubles. But he cried out to them, said that their crops would turn black, that their
            animals would either run, or die, or turn into unrecognisable things. He�s said many things over the years, not sure his head is even screwed on right. Still, he does hear a lot from
            passers by, and our fruits have been souring lately. My sister lives out beyond the woods, close to the deserts, though desert has probably reached her by now. I�m going to leave the
            animals with our Aunt and go out there for a few weeks, just in case. Going to see if I can borrow a gun from a neighbour too, see if they want to join me maybe. Either way, if you feel

        <Text>This world is all that the Necromancer described and worse- a living nightmare. Even the dry ground seems to threaten to swallow me up, to partake of my body and slake its thirst with my
            blood. There are others here, some of whom I have seen in the distance, whilst others are just voices on the wind. They walk aimlessly like purgatorial souls. Even the familiar things are
            alien- the sky is deep red, coloured by the light of three suns, and the air hangs heavy like a miasma. At night the skies glitter with the light of unknown constellations. Despite the dry
            ground and still air this place is not devoid of life. The cooing of brilliantly coloured birds and the churr of spiney insects fills the air. I cannot say with confidence what it is they
            eat- most of the plants I have seen are as pale and brittle as bones, whilst the few that are not bristle with thorns to protect their small fruit. The wind carries with it the braying of
            unknown animals, and the stench of rot- undeniably from others who have passed this way.

            memory, and my instincts are as sharp as this oppressive land allows. I would dearly like to speak to another, to learn more about this world, though I worry that all who wander here will

            the ground where the leaves are not so dense. But I have no memories to go with these sensations, nothing but what I have experienced since I arrived in this wasteland. Here there are no
            living trees, no protective boughs, only dead roots, withered stumps, and stifling heat. Even the water is tainted- potable only to skeletal animals that walk on long limbs, to the spiney
            insects, and to the mysterious birds that fly above. It is like the land is cursed, a curse that threatens to bring me to my knees with every shallow breath. It weighs upon my will,
            begging me to give in to darkness. I utter a prayer under my breath to ward the voices away, but the Necromancer was right, there are no gods listening here.

        <Text>It was not chance that brought me here, but it was not fate either. The Necromancer was adamant that I was chosen for this task, that I alone am able to find and awaken the gods, but can
            I believe her? It seems plausible- likely, even, that I am just one of many, and that I will end up wandering endlessly, searching for purpose until the end of my days like the other souls
            I share this world with. The burden on my mind grows with every passing day, sometimes it lurks in the back of my head, and other times it occupies me completely, leaving me unable to
            focus on anything else. There is something from my past that I do not want to remember. When I try to ignore it I find myself unable, but if try to recall the memory it shrinks back from
            me, retreating into my subconscious.

        <Text>The cloud in my mind grows with every minute that passes. It boils and crackles like a storm eager to break. I worry that I will lose myself here. The air is thin, so I cannot breath
            easily, but it is also heavy, laden with something unseen. It is making me delirious, and I am wracked by panic at every unfamiliar sound. Sometimes I hear distant voices, muffled as if
            speaking from another room. It is as if the walls of the world are thinning in places, bringing the living and the dead close to each other. Some voices are louder than others, so I speak
            out to them, but they do only go quiet, leaving me with nothing but silence. I have passed others living hear, and I have cried out to them too, but they too do not seem to be able to
            hear. Instead they use violence to try to keep me away, but my needs are greater than theirs, and so I do what I must to fulfil my quest. The malice in their eyes disguises the sadness in
            their soul. It is as if they want to die, but they do not know why. If that is the way it must be in this world, then that is the way it shall be. I am not sure if I share the
            Necromancer's faith, but if this world can be saved then I will try.

        <Text>The Necromancer was not honest with me, so I cannot trust her. To find the path to one gate was burdensome enough, but now with four more ahead of me, I am not sure if I will be able to
            go on. I feel only a sense of dread for the path ahead. Amid the great wildernesses that lie before me there are greater dangers than I have already faces. I have seen ancient things that
            rest amongst the dead wastes of civilisation, and doubtless there are more. When I passed through the gate I found myself somewhere new. Where before the gently rolling dunes were broken
            only by great boulders, here the ground is sharp and steep- rising high above to mountain peaks and deep below to the abyssal floor. The stifling heat and thin air of the desert has been
            replaced by a constant feeling of terror.

        <Text>The winds are ceaseless in their howling. Day and night, hour after hour, they blow. From the throaty gusts across the wide mountain passes, to the shrill moan from narrow crevasses that
            echoes between every stone and every wall. Loose rocks thunder to the valley floor, dislodged from scree slopes by great black birds. The primordial majesty of this place is overwhelming.
            It is as if the mountains themselves are alive- great giants moving imperceptibly slowly across the land, speaking to each other through the winds and gales that buffet their peaks. The
            woman of my dreams wordlessly protects me as I sleep, her soothing voice drowning out the windy chaos outside. If only she could be with me in my waking hours, to guide me as I scramble
            between crags, through caves, and under overhangs. I must keep my mind sharp to keep myself from falling victim to the dangers of this land.

        <Text>I have found myself at odds with the land, on the one hand it is truly a terrifying place- even the rocks are razor sharp, and I have cut myself a dozen times trying to navigate my way
            to the landmarks that manage to cling to the rocky slopes. On the other hand it is oddly peaceful. The wind is so constant that it drowns out all thoughts, leaving me to focus only on the
            journey. My instincts take me where I need to be, whilst my mind is clear, the fog suppressed, and my thoughts focussed on the present.

        <Text>The ceaseless winds count down my life, one heartbeat at a time. Everything here seethes at me reaching into me with shadowy claws, desperately pulling at the sanity I struggle to
            maintain. This is why my quest is so dire, if I am to find life, I must keep my mind in check.

        <Text>I know why you are here, Wanderer, even if you do not. You are here because you are needed. It is not often that this world has visitors. No, you did not mishear me, you are in a
            different world now. Wherever you came from is just a memory now, and perhaps not even that. Do not fear the darkness, you are simply dreaming. When you wake you will find yourself
            somewhere that you will not want to be. I am truly sorry for this, Wanderer. I need something from you, and when it is done I vow to return you to where you came.[br]What I ask is no
            trivial thing, and I will say to you now that you may not survive, but I cannot help this. When you open your eyes, you will see a dead world. It is a stagnant place, where civilisation
            and prosperity have given way to death and decay. I come from a time when gods walked upon this earth, but now they are gone- sleeping dreamlessly in their hidden tombs. Wanderer, you must
            find a way to wake them. You must journey across these lands, find their tombs, and bring the gods back to this world so that they may return the world to its former glory.[br]There will
            be obstacles in your path- both physical and psychological. In the great wildernesses of my world there is a corruption- we call it essence- that contorts reality so as to be
            unrecognisable. You will encounter those who have fallen victim to the essence, and who will stop at nothing to stop you in your quest. They will sense, as I can, that you are foreign, and
            do not belong here.[br]When you wake you will see a gate- dormant for now- amid a boundless expanse of sand we call The Whispering Desert. In the desert there is a temple, and in the
            temple is a key. Find the temple, take the key, and return to the gate. It will open for you. I do not know what will come next, but if you pass through the gate I will be waiting for you
            on the other side.

        <Text>You have done well. You have set Eo�s soul free. Already I can feel her voice on the wind, she has already begun cleansing the essence from the earth, I know it. Our victory is small
            however- for there are still four more gods to awaken, and these will not be so easy. The gate you passed through was not just an entrance to Eo�s tomb, but also passage to another gate.
            Each gate is built in a different dominion, in the ashes of the five ancient kingdoms.[br]This gate has brought you to the kingdom of Hythinea, the warrior. Her domain was built along the
            backbone of the world, atop the highest peaks, and in the deepest dells. The once grassy slopes are now barren, and tempestuous winds scour the sharp rocks day and night.[br]This was my
            home. Before I was known as The Necromancer, when the sun rose high and the sky was still blue. I have kept my faith all these years, believing that someone like you would come to save us.
            I was there when the gates were built. I watched the sands encroach and the deserts split our kingdoms apart. I remember when the last flowers faded. I remember when the rivers dried up. I
            remember the day when men lost their voices, and the sounds of animals were replaced with the roars of engines and the screams of the dying. I have waited here a long time, Wanderer, but I
            knew that you would come.[br]You will succeed in your quest, it is your destiny. You will survive, and you will triumph. I have seen it repeated again and again in my dreams. You will save
            me, Wanderer. I have carved your fate into the ruins of our cities. I see in the gods in your eyes, I see passion, and I see survival. So go now, go into the Mountains of Hythinea, where
            the cold winds blow and the sun can barely reach. Find the keys to the gate, and bring this world back to life.
