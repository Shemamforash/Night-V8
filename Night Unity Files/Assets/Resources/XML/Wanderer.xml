		<Text>The land before me �is just as the Necromancer described- blackened, and dying. Even the dry ground seems to creak with hunger, eager to slake its thirst with my blood. There are others here, some of whom I have seen in the distance, whilst others are just voices on the wind. They walk aimlessly like purgatorial souls. Even the familiar is now foreign to me- the sky a deep crimson, lit by the weak glow of three ailing suns, and the air heavy with dread expectation. At night the heavens glitter with the light of a thousand unknown constellations.</Text>

		<Text>Though the ground is arid and the air still, this place is not completely devoid of life. The gentle rustle of the breeze is occasionally broken by the coos of vibrant birds and the churrs of spiny insects. What it is they eat I am not sure, for all the plants I have seen are as brittle and cracked as the dry sand they grow in. The few fruit they bear are wizened, and coloured with such evil hues I would not dare to touch them. The wind carries the braying sound of distant creatures and the rotten stench of the dead and dying.</Text>

		<Text>More unsettling than the blood red sky, the three suns, even the weird magic that grips the world, is the absence of my memory. Since I opened my eyes upon this strange world I have been unable to recall where I have come from or who I was. When I came out of the darkness with the Necromancer it was as if I had been born again, my slate wiped clean. I have not quite forgotten all- my muscles retain their memory, and my instincts are as sharp as this oppressive land allows. I would dearly like to speak to another, to learn more about this world, though I worry that all who wander here will be like me- oblivious ghosts haunting a dead world.</Text>

		<Text>Sometimes I have brief sensations, almost memories, but without context. The feeling of warm light on my back, the green glow of a canopy hit by sun beams above, and dapples of colour on the ground where the light breaks through. But these sensations go unpaired, they match nothing �of what I have experienced, and they do not stir up any lost memories of my past. Here there are no living trees, no drooping boughs, only dead roots, withered stumps, and stifling heat. Even the water is tainted- potable only to skeletal creatures that prowl around on long limbs, to vicious insects that prick at my skin, and to the mysterious birds that fly above. All life in this land is cursed, it is a curse that threatens to bring me to my knees with every shallow breath. It weighs upon my will, begging me to give in to darkness. I utter a prayer under my breath to ward off the voice, but the Necromancer was right, there are no gods listening here.</Text>

		<Text>It was not chance that brought me here, but it was not fate either. The Necromancer was adamant that I was chosen for this task, that I alone am able to find and awaken the gods, but can I believe her? It seems likely that I am just one of many, doomed to wander, endlessly searching for purpose until the end of my days with the other souls that roam here. The burden on my mind grows with every passing day, sometimes lurking in the back of my mind, sometimes occupying me completely- leaving me unable to focus on anything else. There is something from my past that I do not want to remember. When I try to ignore it I find myself unable, but if try to recall the memory it shrinks back from me, retreating into my subconscious.</Text>

		<Text>The cloud in my mind grows with every minute that passes. It boils and crackles like a storm eager to break. I worry that I will lose myself here. The air is thin and I cannot breath easily, when inside it languishes, choking me, forcing me to breathe deeply to expel it from my lungs. It is making me delirious, causing me to jump at every slight sound and flicker of light. Sometimes I hear distant voices, muffled as if speaking from another room. It is as if the walls of the world are thinning, bringing the living and the dead close to each other. Some voices are louder than others, but they go silent as soon as I speak out to them, leaving me in silence once again.</Text>

		<Text>Four gates remain, and I am all but spent. To follow the path to open the Gate of Eo has been burdensome enough, but with four more in wait, I am not sure if I am able to go on. I feel only a sense of dread at the journey ahead. Amid the great wildernesses that lie before me there are greater dangers than I have already faced. I have seen the ancient things that rest amongst the wastes of civilisation, and doubtless there things more horrible still. What shall I find in this new desolation of mountains and crevasses? Where before the gentle rolling of sandy dunes stretched out to the distant horizon, here the ground is sharp, steep, and rises to heights high above and depths below, to mountain peaks and abyssal floor.</Text>

		<Text>To the other people of this world I have cried out, but they do not care to listen. Some sprint away from me, others stare wide eyed, with madness and hate burning in their skull-sockets, and others turn to attack me- slack jawed and vacant. It is as if they want to die, but they do not know why. If that is the way it must be in this world, then that is the way it shall be. I am not sure if I share the Necromancer's faith, but if there is any chance at redemption I will take it.</Text>

		<Text>Day and night, hour after hour, ceaseless in their howling do the mountain winds blow. From the throaty gusts across the wide mountain passes, to the shrill cry through narrow crevasses. The call of the mountain lords echo between every stone and every wall. Dislodged from scree slopes by great black birds, loose rocks thunder to the valley floor below. It is as if the mountains themselves are alive- grey giants moving imperceptibly slowly across the land, speaking to each other through the winds and gales that buffet their peaks. The white woman of my dreams protects me as I sleep, her soothing voice drowning out the winds and chaos outside. If only she could be with me in my waking hours, to guide me as I scramble through crags and caves, and witness the ancient majesty of these black peaks.</Text>

		<Text>I am at odds in Hythinea�s kingdom. It is at once terrifying and peaceful. Constantly I am in fear of slicing my hand open on the razor rocks, and indeed I have cuts and scabs from less fortunate expeditions. But at the same time I have come across many moments of solitude and reflection, times when I can just sit upon the rocks and be alone. The wind is so constant that it drowns out all thoughts, leaving me to focus only on my journey. My instincts take me where I need to be, and my mind is free to wander unburdened by the reality of this world.</Text>

When I find myself able to shut my mind to my fears, despair creeps up on me and throws my mind into turmoil. The dread fog in my mind grows larger every day. It seems that whatever past I have escaped from in coming here is catching up with me. It is only a matter of time before it does.</Text>

		<Text>The life force of the world can be felt everywhere. From the slow rise and erratic fall of the winds, to the calamitous echoes of falling rocks. The beating heart of the earth resounds through the landscape. And with each beat I count down my life, one moment at a time. The shadowy claws of dread and despair desperately pull at the sanity I struggle to maintain. The direness of my quest becomes more apparent every day, this is not merely a journey to save a world I do not know, it is also one to save my very soul.</Text>

		<Text>A new land, different to the last in every way, but the heavy sense of dread in the air remains. An endless plain of salty islands, riven by the hot sun into massive islands. Some cracks are so large one could throw a rock from one wall with all their strength, and still it would not reach the other side. But the gate is still here, like a chisel hammered through these disparate lands, binding them to each other. The daytime sun beats down relentlessly, burning my exposed skin. Even the salt seems to sizzle beneath its burning rays. So I am forced to take shelter in the shadowy cracks in the salt, where the maze like walls hide the remains of the ancient sea.</Text>

		<Text>Now that I have seen the temples and monuments that litter the world I see how the Necromancer could keep her faith through these long eons. I did not believe her talk of dead gods and ancient prophecies when I came here, but now that I have experienced the mysteries of this dead world I have no doubt in her words. Or perhaps it is madness that has driven me to think this way. Perhaps none of this is real, a figment of a disturbed mind, after all, I have never seen The Necromancer in the flesh, only heard her whispering in my head.</Text>

		<Text>Perhaps she is right, perhaps the world can be saved. Am I falling for her spell, or are my thoughts still my own? I am changing, I know it, every moment I am different. Will things ever return to how they were, or is this the new balance? I believe her, I believe the world can be saved- I believe I can be saved. I lost something in my previous life, and now it is hidden in the fog in my mind. I do not know if I should dispel the clouds. I am afraid of what I might find. I do not want to know. The gods will save me, they will bring me back.</Text>

		<Text>I cannot imagine the pain she has been through, to have to watch her entire world fade away before her eyes, helpless to do anything but watch. I feel a similar pain deep inside, when I think about it I find my heart rises to my throat and my breathing comes staggered. I see the face of my dream-angel as if she were before me, and the storm in my mind expands greedily. So I breath deep, I look before me and focus on the things that I believe to be real, and it retreats. My breathing stabilises, and the visions fade.</Text>

		<Text>A terrible sight is before me, a great city in ruins. Buildings that reach far into the heavens above reduced to skeletons of twisted metal, broken glass buried in the ground below, foundations shattered and exposed. There is no life here, no birdsong on the breeze, nothing in the black pools of water in the roads. The trees here are dead, their brittle roots cling to furious earth. How long must it have been for such leviathans to turn to dust, how long since the guards abandoned their posts and the walls left unguarded? And through all that time she has haunted the world. How must it have been to live through those lonely aeons, how could a mind cope through those long years.</Text>

		<Text>Terrible have been the ravages of time upon this ancient city. Even now there remain signs of plight- deep and dark craters, munition cases- rusted and spent, and the twisted carcasses of war machines, now long dead. But there are no bones, no bodies, no graves, no markers of human inhabitation to speak of. Everything that once lived has been swept away. It is horrifying to stand here amongst the ruins, a place where light cannot reach. I know that if the Necromancer were to come here she would fall to her knees and weep. This must be why she whispers in the darkness, to shield herself from reality, to allow herself to have hope in a place where hope dies.</Text>

		<Text>I do not think I could bear to watch my world fall away before me, to watch as the places and people I knew wither and age and eventually die. To have no one to speak to about such things, and be left with only my unquietable thoughts for company. I know I would fall into a coma, reliving my past again and again. I would watch myself, and wish that I could change the mistakes I had once made, that I could go back and right the wrongs with those who are no longer with me.</Text>

		<Text>On my travels I came across the wreck of an ancient boat. Thought its mast was broken, and its sail long since lost, I could see that it once would have flown across the waves swiftly. The planks of its hull were rotten, and its metal supports warped and rusted, but I could tell that it was once strong and sleek, able to glide atop the water�s surface and weather the heaviest of waves. Even now, shattered, and strewn across the wastes, the beauty of the vessel was clear to me, and I will carry that beauty until the end of my days.</Text>

		<Text>The loss of love is hard, but it is living in the absence of that love which is harder. To go about your life as before, but now lacking. To return to a once precious place only to find it has changed, it is no longer yours. The world becomes an illusion, a simulation, moving about you and without you. But time heals all, and we can look back with fondness, not regret. We can find new love, love that does not replace the old but allows us to go on, and with it we may remember the old love without sadness. That is what I wish for The Necromancer, that she may find solace in a new world when our quest is over, and not pine for the old. I will stay here, with her, and together we will find a new love.</Text>

		<Text>There are no voices in my head, I have tried to listen for the gods, but they are not there. The Necromancer promised she would save me, but it is clear now she does not know what to save me from. She is not concerned with my plight, she is concerned only for herself, throughout the years her journey to save the world has clearly turned her to madness. Now the truth wells up inside me- there are no gods, they are dead, leaving behind only whatever corruption was in their souls. Still I will go on, I will find the final tomb, if only to assure myself of this new truth, but also to try and bring the Necromancer back from her insanity.</Text>

It is a sad truth, impossible to bear, yet it is the truth. It is a truth born upon a wind that lifts the weight from my shoulders and draws the despair from my lungs. It provides me with a certainty, where before there was only uncertainty. This dark, dim, and despairing world is doomed. There is nothing left to do, but accept our fate.</Text>

		<Text>There is no saving breath that will bring us back from the beyond. The suns will fade and shrink, and the land will freeze beneath the starless skies, and all the beasts upon the earth will huddle together for warmth as they take their final breaths on this world. The Necromancer cannot accept this fact, and therein lies the root of her madness. I pity her, for I know her struggle. I do not know where she will go when the last gate is opened. I do not think she will ever be whole again. Whoever she was all those years ago is not who she is now. In some ways I envy her blind belief, with it I could ignore the revelation that is coming, but I cannot make myself blind, instead I will have to face the truth.</Text>

		<Text>I can hear in her voice that she suffers still, she has seen the destruction of her home, her world, and her people. She forfeited her life because she believed that one day the world would be cleansed of its corruption. That belief grew stronger with time, growing ever less rational, consuming her. But she had to believe it, because only by the saving the world could her life be saved. We all are prey to these beliefs, we must hold fast to the idea that dark days precede the light, because without it we would be paralysed in hopelessness. It is this belief that allows us to change the course of things, allows us to overcome horror and sorrow, and allows us to live.</Text>
