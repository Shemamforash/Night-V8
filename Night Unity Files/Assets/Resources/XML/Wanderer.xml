		<Text>The land before me is just as the Necromancer said- dark and dying. Even the dry ground seems to creak with hunger, eager to slake its thirst with my blood. There are others here. They are vague shapes on the horizon and subtle whispers on the wind. Purgatorial souls - �fearful and wary. If I am to be alone in my journey, then that is the way it must be.</Text>

		<Text>Sensations come and go, like memories without context. Warm light on my back. The green glow of a sunlit canopy, and dappled colour on the ground where the light breaks through. They match nothing of what I have experienced. Here there are no living trees, no leaf-laden boughs, only dead roots, withered stumps, and stifling heat.</Text>

		<Text>What was once familiar is now foreign to me - the sky a deep shade of crimson, lit by the weak glow of three ailing suns, and the air heavy with dread expectation. At night the heavens glitter with the light of unknown constellations. I am not sure if I will ever share the Necromancer�s faith, but if the alternative is a life of solitude and fear, well, then I will go wherever she bids.</Text>

		<Text>Though the ground is arid and the air still the desert is not completely devoid of life. The gentle rustle of the breeze is broken by the coo of small birds and the churr of insects. The plants I have seen are as brittle and cracked as the dry sand they grow in. The few fruit they bear are wizened, and coloured with such evil hues I would not dare to touch them.</Text>

At first it vexed me, so I approached slowly, only to find it vanish again. Once more I tried, more carefully still, and this time the figure did not vanish. When at last I came upon it, I found a woman. She was clad in ivory robes, and asleep upon the floor. Suddenly I was overcome with unease, for when I looked upon her face, I realised I knew her.</Text>

There we sat together, waiting for� something. But something never came, and I woke confused, with only a greater sense of loss than before.</Text>

I resent her absence when I wake, I think only of her as I walk through twilight lands, and the desire in my heart grows as weariness sets in.

The planks of its hull were rotten, and its metal supports warped and rusted, but I could tell that it was once strong and sleek, able to glide atop the water�s surface and weather the heaviest of waves. Even now, shattered, and strewn across the wastes, the beauty of the vessel was clear to me, and I will carry that beauty until the end of my days.</Text>

		<Text>Everything that once lived here has been swept away. It is good the Necromancer is not with me. If she were to lay her eyes upon the ruin that has come to this place she would fall to her knees and weep. Perhaps that is why she whispers to me from the darkness - to shield herself from reality, to allow herself to have hope in a place where hope dies.</Text>

		<Text>I cannot imagine the things The Necromancer has had to endure. Sometimes I think my burden insignificant compared to hers - �after all what is one life against hundreds? No, that is not fair. I shall not trivialise my own grief, they cannot be compared. The more I stay here, the more I see what has been lost. When this is all over I will return to help her, if I can.</Text>

		<Text>The pain inside grows unbearable, the shadow grows and presses against my skull. I feel my breathing become shallow and my heart rise into my throat. Panic, my vision tunnels, and I collapse to the floor. Then before me I see her, my angel, her hand upon my forehead. Memories explode within me, I see her pale face, flowers, white sheets. �Breathe� she says. I close my eyes and breath deep, and slowly the dark thoughts fade away.</Text>

		<Text>I do not think I could bear to watch my world fall away before me, to watch as the places and people I knew wither and age and eventually die. To have no one to speak to about such things, and be left with only my unquietable thoughts for company, reliving my past again and again. I would watch myself, and wish that I could change the mistakes I had once made, that I could go back and right the wrongs with those who are no longer with me.</Text>

		<Text>Another vision. I saw her from the corner of my eye, she sat at the top of some steps. When I reached her I found her looking at the base of a broken statue. Atop the statues head was a crown, and in his arms a bouquet of flowers. Clearly this man was once well loved by his people. She pointed at the inscription at its base, but it was illegible, the raised stone letters worn away by the wind. None would ever know his name.</Text>

		<Text>I remember a story I heard once, a long time ago. An old man lives in a rickety house. One day a child throws a rock at his window and it shatters. He cries, for he has not the strength to repair it, nor the money to pay another. But he moves on, after all, he has lived through worse. The wind blows through the hole, knocking over his belongings and making an awful din. Rain too comes through the broken window, and ruins his floor. Soon enough the season grows cold, and the snow builds up. But now the window cannot be repaired - the frame is too warped. And so sleeps in the deepening cold, until one day he does not wake up.</Text>

		<Text>Time heals all, and we can look back with fondness, not regret. We can find new love, love that does not replace the old but allows us to go on, and with it we may remember the old love without sadness. That is what I wish for The Necromancer, that she may find solace in a new world when our quest is over, and not pine for the old.</Text>

		<Text>I saw her once again. She sat outside a ruined building reclining on a small drift of sand. So I sat with her, and I asked her how she had escaped her dream prison, but she only gave me a knowing smile and changed the conversation. I do not belong to this world, yet I am growing comfortable here. I am afraid that if I leave I will lose her.</Text>

		<Text>I asked her what would become of her when I return home, but she only smiled and held her fingers to her lips. I will not ask again. I told her I could not lose her, that she must stay, but as soon as I finished speaking I was struck by a flash of painful memories. I awoke with a jolt, confused by the bitter-sweet dream. It is not long until the journey is over.</Text>

		<Text>I have tried to listen, truly, I have. Still I cannot hear the gods, only the whisper of sand and the howl of wind. I want to hear them, even for a moment, to know they are there. Maybe The Necromancer, with her mystic ways, can hear what I cannot. The world does not feel any different to me.</Text>

		<Text>Do you see it when you sleep? Can you hear it in silent places? Do you catch glimpses of it when you blink, as if engraved on the lids of your eyes? It is there, everywhere, in all places, and in all times. Do you not know of what I speak? It is the cold in the pit of your stomach at night, the black thoughts when you are alone. It is the dread, the terrible thought that things will not always be. It is the fear that gives life brilliance. I feel it always, with every waking moment and every darkened sleep. I know you feel it too, we all do.</Text>

		<Text>Here I stand, in the Eternal Wasteland, at the end of all things, searching for something I cannot find, running from something I cannot remember. It is fitting that, if I should die, I should die here, in this bleak landscape, devoid of memory, no evidence of the past, and no future to speak of. At least it would be a peaceful death, with no-one to see, and no-one to mourn.</Text>

		<Text>Though at least a thousand years have passed the scars of the war remain untouched here. The earth has died, and cannot harbour life. Canyons criss cross the landscape, and within them so do the tracks of ancient war machines. The spirits of the dead linger, striking the ground as bolts of lightning, reminding the living that this world is not theirs.</Text>

		<Text>I have seen the gods. I know them to be real. Yet I still cannot believe in them. I simply cannot accept that they can do anything to help me. Indeed they might be able to change this world, and in turn help the Necromancer, but they cannot help me. I will not hide from reality any longer. I have looked for comfort in faith, I have tried to ignore my pain, but the only way to be rid of it is to confront it.</Text>

		<Text>I admit to myself, I have been selfish. I am not looking for the tombs because I wish to help the Necromancer or her world. I do it because I want to be free of my own suffering. At least now I can empathise with her, though she may be blinded by her faith. Together though, we can work together, and perhaps we both can summon the courage to face down our demons.</Text>

		<Text>The gods are gone, fled from this world. The vaults of their tombs are empty, their souls lost to this world. The ingenuity of man has failed. It is a sad truth, impossible to bear, yet it is the truth. It is a truth born upon a wind that lifts the weight from my shoulders and draws the despair from my lungs. It provides me with a certainty, where before there was only uncertainty. This dark, dim, and despairing world is doomed. There is nothing left to do, but accept our fate.</Text>

		<Text>There is nothing that can bring us back from the beyond. The suns will fade and shrink, and the land will freeze beneath the starless skies, and all the beasts upon the earth will huddle together for warmth as they take their final breaths on this world. The Necromancer cannot accept this fact, and therein lies the root of her madness.</Text>

		<Text>I pity her, for I know her struggle. I do not know where she will go when the last gate is opened. I do not think she will ever be whole again. Whoever she was all those years ago is not who she is now. In some ways I envy her blind belief, with it I could ignore the revelation that is coming, but I cannot make myself blind, instead I will have to face the truth.</Text>

		<Text>I can hear in her voice that her suffering grows. With every passing moment her faith is tested, the doubt grows in her mind. She has seen the destruction of her home, her world, and her people. She forfeited her life because she believed that one day the world would be cleansed of its corruption. That belief grew stronger with time, growing ever less rational, consuming her. But she had to believe it, because only by the saving the world could her life be saved.</Text>

		<Text>We all are prey to irrationality, we must hold fast to the belief that our dark days precede the light. Without it we would be paralysed in hopelessness. Only through this belief are we able to change the course of our lives. We can push against the currents of reality rather than allow ourselves to be swept away. To give in is not in our nature, to lay down our arms at the feet of our aggressors rather than fight for what we hold dear. Our belief allows us to overcome horror and sorrow, and go on striving for better days, even when we ourselves may not see them.</Text>

		<Text>We shared another quiet night. She looked well again, though there was a sadness in her voice that couldn�t be displaced. She asked me about the world, but I did not wish to tell her about it. I sensed that her fate is somehow related to the fate of the gods. Instead I told her that the essence was retreating, that it would not be long before I opened the final gate. I expected her to be elated, to beam and throw her arms around me. Instead she smiled weakly, and became quiet. I did not speak further. I did not know what to say, so I let the silence say it for me. We held hands, and when the time came to wake, I kissed her softly. As I left the dream world she held her hand out to me, and said she loved me.</Text>

		<Text>Now I am alone. When I fell asleep she was gone. I called out for her, but there was no answer. I ran through the endless corridors of my mind to find her, but there was nothing but emptiness. I knew she would not return. I had not opened the gates in time, and now she was gone forever. I sat in my dream world, overwhelmed with emotion. Despair and relief washed over me in equal measures. She would not be in pain any longer, but I do not think I can go on without her. The world is so bleak, so harsh, that without hope I cannot hope to overcome it. Despite our short time together, I will not be able to forget her, I know she will be with me until my last breath.</Text>

		<Text>The fog has cleared, and the memories return. The woman, the angel of my dreams, she was real once, a long time ago. I know this, because I was there with her at the end. She believed we would meet again, beyond the veil, she believed it because she had to believe it. Because it was the only thing that would ease the truth of her passing, we knew that nothing could be done for either of us. I am not sure if I believed that we would meet again, but the lie was so sweet. We used the lie to spend our last times in peace and not fear. To pretend to each other as if we were going on a long journey was far easier than to speak a final farewell.</Text>
