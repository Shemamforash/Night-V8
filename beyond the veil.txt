Prologue:

	"These transient lands are the realm of the sleeping gods. Long abandonded by their followers. Worshipped only by the dead and the dying. There are five ruined gates in this world, five portals to a world beyond our own. They cast the veil between our world and theirs. 

The journey to the five gates is far, and you must visit them all to retrieve what you seek. Across the twisted oasis with it's spoiled water and waning flora. Then to the steppe, endless fields wrapped in razored grass, you will find no shelter there. Surviving this you must cross the valley of ruins, where timeless monuments watch over mortal souls. From the ruins  you will come to the great defiles, a natural labyrinth carved by rain over the centuries to break the minds of men. Then to the end you come, to the wastelands that stretch on to the end of time. 

Be wary, o traveller, for as I have said, these lands are transient and wicked. You see, there is a storm- the last trick of a cruel father. It sweeps away the unwary and the unwise, it comes for those who linger and wander without purpose. So dally not, even when hope seems lost, you must stay persistant. Do not start a journey you have no intention of finishing, Wanderer."
	- The Shade

Oasis Dialogue:

And so I awake in the oasis. The shade found me in my darkest moments, knowing what my heart seeks. It has shown me how to find it.
I have not told you why I am here, in a lost place where only evil will tread. But I will, in time.
So strange are Oases, a bloom of life, thriving below the burning sun, where no life should be found.
There was a time when I could fill myself with the life of the trees, to walk amongst the bowers of the forests and feel supple sunshine upon my skin.
But death has come to this place, it has withered the roots of the trees, and turned the canopy above into a pale shroud.
Even the water is tainted, potable only to the skeletal things that live here.
There is a curse here, I can see it in the unnatural green of the dead leaves and hear it churring of carrion insects.
Even the air is tainted. It threatens to bring me to my knees with every staggered breath.
I utter a prayer under my breath to ward away the malady in the air, but to no effect, there is no one to listen here.

Chapter 1 (Introduction to The Wanderer):

It is those of us who face despair who find ourselves in these wild lands. I will tell you the of darkness that I face. I had someone once, but like the vigour of my youth she was taken from me. Her blood was spent on the dry soils of the earth. For a long time I was lost, wandering the world of the living without hope. But then her voice came to me in the Darkness, she told me I would find her at the edge of the world, where the veil is thinnest, and where the living and the dead may cross without barrier. We can be together again, she said, and I can only believe her.

Now all that was us is behind me as I run from the that which is the fate of all things, following the wisdom of my shade. I know there are things in the great wilderness ahead, ancient things that rest amongst the ruins of dead gods and wasted civilisations. There are others who roam and dwell together in solitude, searching for whatever thing holds their hearts the tightest.

I hear the storm every moment of my waking hours, sometimes it is the funeral rattle of sand in my ears, or the wailing of the wind over my head. It comes with the regularity of the tide, threatening its primordial power to sweep clean we devils who look for that which we cannot have. The ceaseless approach of the dust and wind counts down my life, one heartbeat at a time. Everything here seethes at me reaching into me with shadowy claws, desperately clawing at the sanity I cling to just as hard. This is why my quest is so dire, in my search for lost love the land taunts me with an early grave. Though I do not believe death can find me here, no, it is I who will stare down the face of oblivion.
