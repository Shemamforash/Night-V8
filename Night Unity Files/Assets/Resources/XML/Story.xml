		<Part>1</Part>
		<Text>The Corruption of Eo, which now resides somewhere in the veil, takes the form of an enormous skeletal serpent. The form of a serpent is interesting as Eo, goddess of hope, was often represented as an owl swooping down upon the supposed manifestations of despair, generally depicted as a snake. The implications of this form indicate that either Essence has some will of its own, or more likely, that it�s shape is influenced by the strongest emotions within a being. In almost every case these emotions are negative- suppressed anger, primordial fear, greed, and others. Given this knowledge, we have at least some advantage over essence, furthering my hopes that we might one day channel it, and slowly return our world to how it was.</Text>

		<Text>Hythinea, the warrior queen, and her kingdom Hythia, can all be found deep in the great mountain ranges of the north. In the days of old these lands were renowned for their fertility, and in the infancy of our civilisations were protected by Hythinea herself. Ferocious but fair, her traits were soon idolised by the people of her kingdom, who built their society around her values. Soon Hythia became the dominant kingdom of the five, and became infamous for their strength in the great war that precipitated the end of our world. Little is know about her Corruption, it has never been seen outside of the veil, or the world between the gates. However, given our knowledge of the other Corruptions, we can assume that personifies the opposite of her personality, most likely injustice, bloodlust, ignorance, and hostility.</Text>

		<Text>The god Rhallos imbued solidity, determination, and resolve. It is not unexpected then, that the form of his corruption is that of a disparate hive of flying things. Some have seen it in our world, like a living cloud that passes over the land devouring any living thing with its hundreds of tiny jaws. Although not the most terrifying of the Corruptions, it instills feelings of absolute hopelessness in those who see it. Thankfully I have only heard this from third parties, or I fear I would not be able to write this down for even recollecting the events caused most of my sources to break down in tears, and in one case, turn completely rigid and unresponsive to anything around them.</Text>

		<Text>Vidium, or Moonmetal as it is sometimes known, is a peculiar alloy found only in meteorites. It is unknown if it could be found naturally before the Absence, but can now be found in relative abundance (for a rare metal) due to increased cosmic activity. Although essence appears to affect all things in at least some degree, Vidium has a strong focussing effect that apparently draws essence towards itself. For this reason alone Vidium is extremely difficult to gather, and even more so to manipulate. The properties of this pitch black metal are extremely desirable however, and is now highly coveted in the manufacturing of war machines and weaponry.</Text>

		<Title>Tome of Mystics: Essence</Title>
		<Group>2</Group>
		<Part>1</Part>
		<Text>The effects of Essence are always sudden, but not always apparent. The subtleties of its nature mean that rather than a sudden outburst against all nearby, or an immediate and incurable fear that causes a man to gouge out his own eyes rather than face the world, the influence of Essence can go unnoticed for extremely long periods of time. Sometimes the effect is so subtle, given a host of good character and strong will, that it never manifests outwardly (though it is extremely where). In other cases it grows over time, embeds itself in the subconscious, ultimately leading to betrayal, desertion, sedition, and murder. I believe this clearly demonstrates it is the hosts will that gives form to the Essence, and that the Essence itself has no ability to decide whether its manifestation is benign or malign.</Text>

		<Group>3</Group>
		<Part>1</Part>
		<Text>I will document, for the purposes of posterity, the details of our order. After it became clear that the world was dying through no fault of our own, the learned people of the five kingdoms came together to form the Order of Mystics. Initially the group was loosely defined, it�s members came and went as the Essence exerted its influence across the world. I, and a few others, formed a small band dedicated to understanding the Essence, and how it came to be. It did not take us long to draw the conclusion that it was the absence of the gods that gave rise to the calamity that was before us, and that it was their presence that maintained some sort of balance in the Essence that exists within our world. At that time we were aware of the existence of Essence, but its nature was foreign to us, and we were not unanimously convinced of its existence at first.</Text>

		<Text>Over the years our order watched the kingdoms of our world fight against each other, and one by one each fell. Whether in the tracks and weaponry of the battlefield, or by the slow decline of authority they all fell. It was becoming apparent that a great collapse was coming soon. It could be felt all around like the acrid taste on the tongue before lightning strikes. We resolved that our efforts to manipulate the Essence were paramount, that we must find a way to use it, or our entire world would unravel around us. We could see that the borders between the kingdoms were fading, the scars of war filled in slowly by the sands of encroaching deserts. Eventually, we knew, it would be impossible to cross between the kingdoms. It was then that the idea of the gates was born, we would utilise our technology and research on Essence to create a portal in each kingdom. Each portal would allow free travel to another kingdom, forming a spine, if you will, across the world. What we did not realise at the time, however, was that without a body capable of channelling essence, these gates would be useless to us.

		<Text>The Necromancer was an idea that arose over a period of months, after we realised that the now complete gates were all but useless to us. Many of us gave up, threw our hands in the air in anguish, and simply disappeared into the wastes. Those that remained, myself included, resolved to find a solution. Though I cannot speak for the motives of the other Mystics, I resolved to do all I could because the alternatives were simply too bleak to consider. Without the ability to pass between the gates we would be without the ability to communicate with the now isolated communities scattered amongst the five kingdoms, and without the ability to restore the world. It is worth noting that our studies at this point had turned to what could at best be considered arcane and at worst sorcery. Manipulating essence is no simple matter. Through various testing methods we found that the most effective, yet unpleasant, way of channelling essence was through pain. I am sure that to whoever reads this account, assuming anyone is left to read it, will think us as sun-scorched mad men, making blood pacts and casting magic spells into the darkness. How I wish this were not so.

		<Text>It was in the Autumn of the year 3346 that we made our ultimate choice. We did not force anyone to stay, those who were in the dark were informed of our intentions, and given the opportunity to leave. Few did, some stayed out of loyalty, others because leaving was simply no better than what was ahead. One of our order was chosen, a young woman- an acolyte from the mountain kingdom. There has been no protest over what we are about to do, because there are no other options. We grew weak with every day that passed, and every day the essence spread further, rooted deeper, hung heavier in the air around us. I am sorry, reader, that we could not do more. This will be the last entry in my histories, if they can be called that. I do hope that there will be enough future to fill the remaining pages of this book.[br][br]With hope, Oranos.</Text>

The king sits upon his throne at the head of the room, alone and brooding. We are left to discuss our options, it is clear we are at war, whether it is in the best interests of our land or not, we are at war. My peers seem excited by the prospect, as if the encroaching bloodshed has somehow been expected and deserved. I have no doubts that the courts of the four other great kingdoms are issuing their own orders, and that their Kings and Queens have withdrawn into the same solitude as our own. I will not lie my own thoughts have been darkened of late. I fear there has been a change in us, all of us, across this entire world.</Text>

		<Text>Today we broke into the city of Hispellum, infantry following the path of our siege engines straight into their main square. Only to find the resistance we expected was absent. The city was silent, the defenders on the walls were silent now- dead or dying. But here there was nothing, no signs of flight, banners taken from their polls. It is as if it had been abandoned for years. We searched house after house, looked in the warehouses, the armouries, the keeps, all the way up to the court and even the monarch�s tombs. It was then, as we stood in the court of Hispellum, before the throne of the King, that a strange feeling came over me. It has been at least a decade since I left our fair city. A decade that me and my men have lived in the great battlefields that now scar the space between our lands. I worry that if I were to return home, that I would find our halls empty, I would find my family fled and my house deserted. We have fulfilled our duty, we have taken the city. But now we are without orders and there are now none to issue them. It is bitter sweet, this victory, for on the very day of our victory, we are turning about, and returning home.[br][br]-Optio

For we could see, even at this great distance, that our city was ruined and deserted. There was no life on the charred plain before us. Some of my brothers and sisters fell to their knees and would not be moved. Some ran for the city, others away. I did not stop anyone. There was no reason. It was clear my instinct was right- somehow over all these years, through all the battles and the roaring of thunder, we have destroyed ourselves. Our kingdoms have fallen, where our people are I do not know. What will become of us I do not know. What I do know, that I predicted all those years ago, and that has now been confirmed by the horrifying sight ahead, is that this war was indeed the last war of our world.[br][br]-Optio</Text>

Like inky shadows rising up from the ground and sinking back into it a moment later. Howls too, not like dogs, no, these are shallow, hoarse- like a dying man�s croak. Sometimes an animals gone by morning, no traces left, not even footprints, almost like they just vanished.

But he cried out to them, said that their crops would turn black, that their animals would either run, or die, or turn into unrecognisable things. He�s said many things over the years, not sure his head is even screwed on right. Still, he does hear a lot from passers by, and our fruits have been souring lately. My sister lives out beyond the woods, close to the deserts, though desert has probably reached her by now. I�m going to leave the animals with our Aunt and go out there for a few weeks, just in case.

		<Text>We are alike, you and I, each of us look out upon this world and we do not recognise what we see. Yet I was born here, and you, you are merely a traveller to these lands. A welcome one indeed, but a stranger still- a wanderer. Your destiny is to pass through this world, whilst I must persist. I remember when these lands were green, free of disease, and so bountiful that none would go wanting. Now they are dead. Scored by the sun, dry, and soaked in the blood of war. I know why it is that you are here, wanderer. You are here because you have lost yourself, you have stared too long into the darkness, and now the darkness has become you. I will help you recover, I will give you back your mind, and your soul, and I will fill the aching hole within you. But you will help me.[br]What you behold is a dead world- a stagnant place where civilisation and prosperity have wasted with the passing of the ages, leaving only barbarism and hopelessness in their stead. I come from a time when gods walked upon this earth, but they too are gone- lost in eternal sleep in their hidden tombs, in the places that sit at the edge of our sight. This I tell you, is your task- you must wake the gods, and return them to my world. This is the only way to reverse what has been done, and turn sickness to remission. To do so you will must embark on a journey across these lands, to find the hidden tombs, and break the chains that bind the gods to their slumber. When you have done this, when they have returned and the world cured, then your task will be complete, and you will be whole again.[br]Your path is not an easy one, there will be dangers, both physical and psychological. The disease that has rocked this world will try to claim you. It will prick your skin and beat at your mind. It will be aggressive, and it will know you, for you are foreign and uncorrupted- a beacon for the darkness. We call this disease essence, and indeed it is the essence of the world, unfettered and unchained. Once it gave strength to the gods, now unbound it breeds only chaos. Feeding on our desires, our fears, all that we desire but do not give voice. All you will encounter, be it man, beast, or plant, have fallen to the disease. Some may still resist, and they may even offer to aid you. Others, however, will sense that you do not belong here, and they will stop at nothing to rid you from the world.[br]When you wake you will see a gate amid the boundless sandy expanse of The Whispering Desert. The gate is dormant, for now, but when awakened will allow you to travel into The Veil, and in that place you will find the tomb of the goddess Eo, whose mind you must unburden from pain. There is a temple deep in the desert. It is a cursed place, but if you can find away to cleanse it, it will open the gate for you. I do not know what events will transpire when you pass through the veil, but I will be waiting for you on the other side, no matter what happens.

		<Text>So it is done, you have passed through the gate and the realm between the shadows. You have done what none have managed before. Already I hear a voice on the wind, the voice of Eo- beautiful yet haunting, calling for her lost siblings. How must it feel, to awaken after so many years, to see your beautiful world in ruins. But I saw it happen, I saw life of the land fade and turn to ash. I watched as the strength of the earth was drained away, and the spirit of the earth enfeebled before my eyes. I was cursed to remain, to be here to watch everything I loved fade away, to see my friends and my family die, doomed to solitude by my permanence. I do not feel pity for the dead, wanderer, for it is the living alone who are left who grieve.[br]We stand now in the kingdom of Hythinea, the warrior goddess, queen of motherhood. This was once the the backbone of the world. Atop the highest mountains were built her fortresses, and in deepest dells her cities. Gone are the grassy slopes with their grazing flock. Gone are the roads where merchants once ran their goods. Gone are the flowered pastures and gentle rivers. Now there is only dirt and rock amongst the shattered peaks. Dark shadows cast by black crags, and the eyes of evil looking out from their caves.[br]This was my home. Before I became The Necromancer, when the sun rose high and the sky was still blue. I have kept my faith all these years, believing that someone like you would come to save us. I was there when the gates were built. I watched as the sands encroach upon our kingdoms, and with them our ties to our brothers and sisters disappear on the desert winds. I remember when the last flowers faded. I remember when the rivers dried up. I remember the day when the brave lost their voice, and the braying of animals replaced by screams of the dying. I have waited here a long time, Wanderer, but I knew that you would come.[br]It is your destiny to succeed. I have seen it repeated again and again in my dreams. You will save me, Wanderer. I have carved your fate into the ruins of our cities. I see in the gods in your eyes, I see passion, and I see survival. So go now, go into the mountains, where the cold winds blow and the sun cannot survive. Activate the gate, and bring this world back to life.

		<Text>Do you see it when you sleep? Can you hear it in silent places? Do you catch glimpses of it when you blink, as if engraved on the lids of your eyes? It is there, everywhere, in all places, and in all times. Do you not know of what I speak? It is the cold in the pit of your stomach at night, the black thoughts when you are alone. It is the dread, the terrible thought that things will not always be. It is the fear that gives life brilliance. I feel it always, with every waking moment and every darkened sleep. I know you feel it too, we all do.[br]It is always darkest before the dawn, or so they say. There can be no triumph without sacrifice. Even as the sickness that pervades this world tightens its grip, there is still a chance for redemption. My people have known for a long time that our sacrifice must be paid in blood. There were many of us in the beginning. So many who gave their lives to halt the spread of evil. Scholars, teachers, students, clerics- all those who could dedicate their minds to our cause, these were my people. They called us the Mystics, a name we came to embrace as time went on. It was they who made me what I am today, incapable of death, but unable to do anything but pass through my lands like a ghost.[br]I am all that remains of our order, my burden to hold the last vigil of the Mystics. I have watched the spread of the corruption, written what I saw down so that future generations will know what came after our great war. I documented it all. I wrote as the sun swelled and turned red, as the cities crumbled and their foundations turned to sand. The world is tearing itself apart, atom by atom. The very essence of the earth is corrupted, giving flesh to the nightmares of men, perverting all that is right. The gods maintained this essence, and in their absence there was nothing but chaos to direct it. Now you know why there are things in the wastes that you cannot believe to exist. It is the essence that gives unnatural life to those who wander freely in the world. With every passing moment I see the essence entering into you, giving you strength. You must not let it take a hold of you. You must maintain your resolve.

Together we worked the land, it was enough to survive, and we tried to get along as best we could. But we were not neighbours, we were survivors, refugees forced together to prevail.

As time passed the divide grew, exacerbated by stories from the outer world- tales of barbarism, murder, defilement, inhumanity. The strings of our relationships were pulled tighter and tighter, until one day, they snapped.</Text>

		<Text>One day, like many days before it, a bleached wastelander came to our village. He was not like others that had come, there was something unhinged in him, of course we all had a burden to bear, but his was different. We found him a bed, gave him food and drink, and left him to rest. He did not speak, but he laid his leering eyes upon every woman he encountered. Ill at ease we went to our homes to rest for the night. In the morning we found the body. A young woman, her body cut and bloody, lay across the threshold of the wastelander�s tent. There was no discussion, no words spoken, we simply drew him from his tent, and broke his body in the middle of the village.</Text>

		<Text>When the bodies were buried we argued about what should be done. Words turned to insults, insults to accusations, and soon we were split, two sides warring over peace. The first stone was thrown, and others followed. Then there was pandemonium, fist fights escalated into murder, and there was only chaos. I gathered my family, shouting for them to gather as much as we could, and we ran into the forest. There were other families, couples, elders, and children, all running from the village as fast as we could. And then the pursuits started, the people we had lived with every day for years now hunted us with teeth and nails, blades, farming tools, and guns. I did not look back, I only simply ran from the screams. By the time the noises had died away, I was lost, the trees were thinning, and the grass at my feet given away to the dry dirt of the wasteland beyond. I did not know where my family was. I still do not know, I hope that one day our paths will cross, for I am sure they did not perish, but I cannot go looking for them, I do not know where to look, instead I have only one thing left- survival.

I prefer to think we are in a dream now, because even then we would one day wake up, even if now we have to live in this nightmare. I dont know if I had a family, I must have done, though they are long dead by now I assume. Wandering is all I know, going from place to place, there is so much that has been left undone in this world.

There is a dark shadow within us all, a hidden thing kept at bay by our civil self. It is in our most passionate moments that it is set free, free to do what our primal instinct knows should be done. They say that the world fell because our minds were changed, that we were turned evil by devils or monsters. They are wrong. The devil is a part of us, it is a reflection of our surface selves, the inversion of our conscious mind. It is the essence in the air that drew it out, empowering it, and allowing it to maraud openly. But I have controlled it, I let it escape, feed, exert it�s will through my hand. It is this freedom that prevents it from taking a hold of me. I acknowledge it, and so we coexist.</Text>

When the covenant is made between you and the beast it is like a weight lifted from your mind. Our darkest thoughts are free to expose, explore, and exploit. I revel in my freedom, I have shirked the shackles of civilisation to sate my primal thirst. Do not care for those who would do you harm, for they are nothing but fodder for the beast.

That is why the beast is important, it gives us life, it is our source of true emotion, raw feelings. If anyone reads this, go forth, allow the wolf within to burst forth, say those words that are unsaid, seek vengeance when justice is undone, conquer the oppressors and lift up the meek. And if you should fall in your pursuit for balance, you will know that it was for a glorious purpose that your fire was snuffed. The worst that can befall is that we instead allow our flame to dim and die in the darkening of the night, our mind full of regrets and things left undone.</Text>

Every month, in an attempt to show his humanity, he would gather his people, and select one to bestow a great gift upon. He would take them out of the settlement in his great vehicle, far beyond the horizon, to a place no-one saw or knew about.

Deep through the the great machine they went, down to the salty floor below. He beckoned for them to enter the vehicle, and begin their journey to salvation. It was far, to go beyond the bounds that confined them. The self-proclaimed king spoke not a word, and gave them not a glance.

The mother started to weep, for she knew that despite the rivers that ran through the land, despite the green fields that beckoned to her, she knew it was as hostile to life as any desert.

Suddenly the woman spun round, digging her fingers deep into his forearms, running them down his flesh in long red streaks. He screamed out in pain and pushed her to the ground. Blood spilling onto the blinding white floor, immediately absorbed by the grateful earth. He ran back to his car, started the engine, and drove away as he tried to tend to his wounds. Glancing up, he saw her in the mirror, still on the floor, a mask of anger worn upon her face. As they grew smaller he knew his reign had ended. He could not give hope to his people, not now that the veil had been lifted from his eyes. And so exiled himself into the desert. His compassion towards his people blinded him to the reality of his actions. To this day he carries those scars, a reminder that we are all equal in the dust.</Text>

For this is a godless world, and faith has no place in it� I replied. At this they made an unusual smile. �My daughter, do you not believe in the gods?� asked one. �It is well known that the gods abandoned our world, so why would I worship those that would leave us to this fate?� I replied. �But my child it was not they who caused the world to come to ruin. Their plan is perfect, it is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves worthy. That is our pursuit� another said. �Then that is a worthy goal, and I commend you for it, but by testing our worthiness the gods have demonstrated that they do not have faith in us.

One of the group sat on the ground next to me and we watched the sun go down. �It is a beautiful gift, don�t you think?� she said. Confused, I asked �What do you mean, a gift?�. �The sun- it is a gift from them, as are our eyes so that we might see it.� she said. �You believe they gave us the sun?� I asked. �Why of course, they gave us everything they created� she said. At this I was silent for some time. �I shall tell you where my doubts lie, sister. You say the world is a gift, for which the gods ask nothing in return, but you do not see it how I do. If it is a trivial task for them to create all that exists, so then it is nothing for them to give it away, for it is worth nothing. On the other hand if it was no trivial task, and required everything from them, then what they receive is servitude- belief and worship. This then shows that they are selfish, they gave us gifts expecting our praise in return. I see no reason to worship a being who would give us something worthless to them, or one who would give us something, only to make a demand we cannot refuse as payment.

People say it once sat on an island amidst a boundless sea, if that is true, then surely it must have been a long time ago. My father took me to this church on my tenth birthday. The air in the church was as stifling as it was hot, the ancient boards of the wooden walls creaking in the breeze. He stood by the altar at the head of the church, and he commanded me 'Son, tell me what you see here�. I did not understand, other than the ancient building itself, there was nothing of interest, and I told him just that. �And that is exactly why I brought you here.� he said. �This church is the last worship place of the gods, and yet there is no one here, there are no worshippers, no candles, not even a seat for a pilgrim to sit� he went on. �This is because the gods are ignorant, boy. They have abandoned us. There will be no response to our prayers, we drive our own path in this world.�.

And yet it has always stuck with me, there are many who still pray for better times, for their children, and their crops, and their sick. But I never have, not since that day. It was not long after that my father took ill. It was the waste that took him, bound him to his bed, dishonoured his pride. Not once did he pray on his death bed. He did not ask for medicine, for he knew there was none, he had consigned himself to his fate.

The only measure of justice to be found lies in my hands, in the keenness of my eye, and the surety of my arm. Only the fool waits for justice from the divine. And whilst the fool waits, the thief takes what he wishes. Some may preach, they may say that our acts come about, that the farmer reaps what he sows, but I believe in vengeance. I believe in the immediacy of physical judgements that show the thieves and the scoundrels that there are those who exact their own divine will.

Even the dry ground seems to threaten to swallow me up, to partake of my body and slake its thirst with my blood. There are others here, some of whom I have seen in the distance, whilst others are just voices on the wind. They walk aimlessly like purgatorial souls. Even the familiar things are alien- the sky is deep red, coloured by the light of three suns, and the air hangs heavy like a miasma. At night the skies glitter with the light of unknown constellations. Despite the dry ground and still air this place is not devoid of life. The cooing of brilliantly coloured birds and the churr of spiney insects fills the air. I cannot say with confidence what it is they eat- most of the plants I have seen are as pale and brittle as bones, whilst the few that are not bristle with thorns to protect their small fruit. The wind carries with it the braying of unknown animals, and the stench of rot- undeniably from others who have passed this way.

The feeling of warm light on my back, the rich green glow of leaves hit by sun beams above, dapples of light on the ground where the leaves are not so dense. But I have no memories to go with these sensations, nothing but what I have experienced since I arrived in this wasteland. Here there are no living trees, no protective boughs, only dead roots, withered stumps, and stifling heat. Even the water is tainted- potable only to skeletal animals that walk on long limbs, to the spiney insects, and to the mysterious birds that fly above. It is like the land is cursed, a curse that threatens to bring me to my knees with every shallow breath. It weighs upon my will, begging me to give in to darkness.

The air is thin, so I cannot breath easily, but it is also heavy, laden with something unseen. It is making me delirious, and I am wracked by panic at every unfamiliar sound. Sometimes I hear distant voices, muffled as if speaking from another room. It is as if the walls of the world are thinning in places, bringing the living and the dead close to each other. Some voices are louder than others, so I speak out to them, but they do only go quiet, leaving me with nothing but silence. I have passed others living hear, and I have cried out to them too, but they too do not seem to be able to hear. Instead they use violence to try to keep me away, but my needs are greater than theirs, and so I do what I must to fulfil my quest. The malice in their eyes disguises the sadness in their soul. It is as if they want to die, but they do not know why. If that is the way it must be in this world, then that is the way it shall be. I am not sure if I share the Necromancer's faith, but if this world can be saved then I will try.
